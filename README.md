# MimicTense

MimicTense is a Swift based neural network framework. It is designed to be cross
platform, and uses platform specific low level neural network frameworks. 
The low level neural networks are wrapped in a backend framework that is messaged
through a front end framework using Swift distributed actors. The front end designed for
users to develop models using a domain specific language(DSL).

Currently, the framework to train models is under development, which makes it impracticable
for any production work.
